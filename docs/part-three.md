# Part 3: Orchestrate a Multi-Account Monorepo with Code Generation and Reusable Modules

In this part, you will set up a larger-scale Terraform monorepo that builds on part-2, leveraging Terramate's powerful orchestration capabilities, create reusable modules with code generation and see how its like to work with terraform.

From now on we will not disable safeguards which means you will need to git add your changes. At the end of this part you will merge your changes back to main so that we can test out Terramate's [change detection](https://terramate.io/docs/cli/change-detection/). That's why it is important that you are working off your own fork of this repository.

## Instructions

‚úÖ If you plan to run terraform commands while following along, you will need to change the `account_id` to an account that you have access to, as well as setting your AWS credentials session with permissions for that account.

```bash
# live/prod/account-a/account.tm.hcl

globals "aws" {
  name       = "account-a"
  account_id = "?"
}
```

### Orchestration

<https://terramate.io/docs/cli/orchestration/>

#### Boostrap

You will need to have remote-state s3 backend to be able to run terraform commands with a remote-backend configuration.

The stack located in `live/prod/account-a/boostrap` generates the module code that you can deploy (remember to change the account_id). We can't add a backend config until we have deployed the remote-state. So we've included `no-backend` tag to the stack config which tells `mixins/backend.tm.hcl` to ignore this stack.

To dynamically generate the module for remote-state we use an experimental feature `tmgen`. The experimental feature have already been added to `terramate.tm.hcl`. <https://terramate.io/docs/cli/code-generation/tmgen#example>

Review the `main.tf.tmgen` file and generate.

```bash
terramate generate
# add and commit changes
git add .
```

#### Deploy Remote State

Use terramate to provision the remote state bucket specifically using orchestration. <https://terramate.io/docs/cli/orchestration/scripts>

1. We can apply the remote-state using either scripts or inline with following command.

```bash
terramate --chdir live/prod/account-a/bootstrap/remote-state run -- sh -c '
  terraform init &&
  terraform apply -input=false -auto-approve
  '
```

2. Remove the `no-backend` tag from the stack and regenerate to create the `_backend.tf`.

3. Reinitilize terraform to push the remote-state state to s3

```bash
terramate --chdir live/prod/account-a/bootstrap/remote-state run -- terraform init -migrate-state

# add and commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: deploy remote-state bucket to prod account-a"
```

> üß† Idea. Why not have a terramate script command - which creates the bucket > removes the no-backend tag > generates backend config and reinitializes the state using the new backend!

### Order of execution

Controlling the order of execution. Add the following to the `security-group` stack block to ensure that it always run after the `vpc` stack. <https://terramate.io/docs/cli/stacks/configuration#explicit-order-of-execution>

```bash

stack {
  ...

  after = [
    "tag:vpc",
  ]
}
```

Check the order of execution

```bash
terramate list --run-order
```

### Proceed to the Next Step

Once you have completed Part 3, proceed to Part 4 by checking out the next tag:

```sh
git checkout part-4
```

Nice seeing you are still here .. üññüèº
