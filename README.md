# Terramate Workshop

Welcome to the Terramate Workshop! This workshop is designed to guide you through the essentials of using Terramate to manage Terraform at scale. You will learn how to add Terramate to an existing Terraform project, refactor Terraform configurations, generate Terraform code with Terramate, and orchestrate a large-scale multi-account Terraform monorepo. By the end of this workshop, you will have a fully functioning setup with pull requests and GitHub Actions workflows.

## Workshop Overview

In this workshop, you will:

1. **Add Terramate to an Existing Terraform Project**: Learn how to integrate Terramate into your current Terraform setup.
2. **Refactor Terraform and Introduce Code Generation**: Organize and refactor your Terraform codebase for better maintainability and scalability, and use Terramate to generate Terraform configurations dynamically.
3. **Orchestrate a Multi-Account Monorepo with Code Generation and Reusable Modules**: Set up a large-scale Terraform monorepo that spans multiple AWS accounts, leveraging Terramate's powerful orchestration capabilities and reusable modules.
4. **Implement CI/CD with GitHub Actions**: Integrate your Terraform workflows with GitHub Actions to automate testing, validation, and deployment through pull requests.

Each step of the workshop includes detailed instructions and examples to help you understand and apply the concepts effectively. Whether you are new to Terramate or looking to enhance your Terraform management skills, this workshop will provide you with the knowledge and tools you need to succeed.

## How to Follow the Workshop

To ensure that each participant has the correct structure to complete each step, the required files and directories for each part of the workshop are contained in their own tag within the git repository. These tagged commits are never updated during the workshop.

To switch to the appropriate tag for each part of the workshop, use the following commands:

1. **Add Terramate to an Existing Terraform Project**:

    ```sh
    git checkout part-1
    ```

2. **Refactor Terraform and Introduce Code Generation**:

    ```sh
    git checkout part-2
    ```

3. **Orchestrate a Multi-Account Monorepo with Code Generation and Reusable Modules**:

    ```sh
    git checkout part-3
    ```

4. **Implement CI/CD with GitHub Actions**:

    ```sh
    git checkout part-4
    ```

Each tag contains the necessary files and directory structure for that part of the workshop. Follow the instructions provided in each part to complete the workshop successfully.

Let's get started!
